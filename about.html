    </section>

    <!-- Executive Summary -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>We are developing an Intelligent Chemical Waste Management System to address key challenges in laboratory waste handling. This system uses IoT hardware—a smart lid and weighing base for standard 20L waste buckets—integrated with sensors for barcode scanning, VOC detection, temperature monitoring, and weight tracking, plus cloud-based software for real-time compatibility checks and data logging.</p>
      <p>It serves academic, pharmaceutical, and government labs by reducing safety risks from incompatible chemical mixes, streamlining compliance audits, and automating manual records.</p>
      <p>Our goal is to make waste management safer and more efficient without overhauling existing workflows. We are now seeking input from domain experts like you to refine our approach. We invite you to participate in a short interview or survey to share your experiences with lab waste management. Your insights will help us build a practical tool that meets real needs, potentially saving time on audits and reducing incident risks.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Who We Are -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>We are a group of NYU students (six people total, ranging from freshman to graduate) focusing on laboratory safety solutions. Based in regions serving the US, China, and developing countries markets, our mission is to create digitized tools that solve "information black box" issues in chemical waste management, ensuring compliance with frameworks like EPA, RCRA, and Chinese GB standards.</p>
      <p>Our team brings expertise in hardware integration, sensor technology, and most importantly, the passion for bringing positive impact to society and addressing ESG challenges globally.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- The Problem -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>Laboratories face ongoing issues with chemical waste:</p>
      <ul class="problem-list">
        <li><strong>Opaque Records:</strong> Unclear bucket contents and difficult compatibility judgments that risk reactions like explosions</li>
        <li><strong>Manual Overhead:</strong> Time-consuming manual inspections and logging</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance Burden:</strong> Strict regulatory demands that make audits error-prone</li>
        <li><strong>Safety Risks:</strong> These pain points can result in safety incidents, fines, and operational delays</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="highlight-text">For example, EPA penalties can reach $37,500 per day for violations. OSHA reports that chemical exposures account for a significant portion of lab-related injuries.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Our Approach -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Our Approach</h2>
      <p>We are building a modular system that adapts to standard 20L waste buckets with:</p>
      <div class="feature-grid">
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>Smart Hardware</h4>
          <p>Lid for scanning and sensors (barcode for chemical ID, VOC for gas leaks, temperature for reaction detection, weight for fill levels) with a base for stability</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>Cloud Platform</h4>
          <p>Data transmission for compatibility checks using rule-based algorithms, logging, and alerts</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>AI & ML Integration</h4>
          <p>Detecting, recording, and potentially addressing anomalies in the local and cloud system</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="note-text"><strong>Note:</strong> This is NOT a full ERP overhaul, source reduction tool, or solution for biological/radioactive waste. We focus on chemical waste tracking and monitoring.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Who It's For -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Who It's For</h2>
      <p>This system is designed for:</p>
      <ul class="audience-list">
        <li><strong>Researchers & Technicians:</strong> Professors, scientists, and lab technicians who handle daily waste</li>
        <li><strong>EHS Staff:</strong> Environmental Health & Safety professionals managing compliance</li>
        <li><strong>Administrators:</strong> Leaders in universities, pharmaceutical companies, government institutions (NIH, CDC), and independent testing labs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It fits environments like academic chemistry labs, pharma R&D, and materials science settings where chemical waste is common.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Current Stage -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Current Stage</h2>
      <p>The project is in the early prototype phase, with:</p>
      <ul class="stage-list">
        <li>Managerial framework and team construction complete</li>
        <li>Hardware designs outlined</li>
        <li>Software architecture planned for initial pilots in the next 12 months</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your feedback now will inform us on the real demands and workflow of chemical labs, influencing our key features such as sensor priorities, user interface simplicity, and integration needs. This will ensure the system aligns with real lab workflows before full deployment.</p>
